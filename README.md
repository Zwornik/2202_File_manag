File Duplicate Manager

This app resolves the problem I have with pictures automatically synchronising from my phone to my OneDrive folder. At the same time, I have some of these pictures already sorted and saved in various folders in the same OneDrive.

I needed a file manager able to find duplicates between two selected folders (including subfolders) and provide the functionality of selecting a location from which duplicates could be deleted with a single click.

Also, the program can extract the latest date from picture EXIF metadata, compare it with dates provided by Windows and display the oldest.
