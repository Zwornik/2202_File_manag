</head>File Manager<head>
This app resolves the problem I have with pictures automatically synchronising from my phone to my OneDrive folder. At the same time, I have some of these pictures already sorted and saved in various folders named with the event name in the same OneDrive.

I needed a file manager able to find duplicates between two selected folders (including subfolders) and provide the functionality of selecting a location from which duplicates could be deleted with a single click.
